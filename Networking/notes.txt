To get detailed network info:
	ipconfig /all | more

DHCP servers hand out IP addresses.
IPv4 has an address space of 2^32.
IPv6 has an address space of 2^128.

To find the IP for a domain name use nslookup:
	nslookup www.google.com
	nslookup
		google.com (domain name to lookup)
	nslookup
		server 129.65.16.254 (IP for a DNS)
		google.com (domain name to lookup)

To see all of the cached DNS records:
	ipconfig /displaydns

By default nslookup will show A record types, those that turn a domain name into an IP.

To lookup NS records:
	nslookup
		set type=NS
		www.google.com

To lookup MX (Mail Exchange) records:
	nslookup
		set type=NS
		www.google.com

To lookup CNAME (alias) records:
	nslookup
		set type=CNAME
		www.google.com

Routers route traffic between subnets.

To see all the router hops traffic has to take to get from A to B:
	tracert www.google.com
	pathping www.google.com

Subnets are defined by a combination of the IP and subnet mask.
Subnet masks have 4 octets (8 bits each):
	255.255.255.000 (24 bit subnet mask)
The route table determines how a computer can reach other sub networks:
	route print

Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to translate between puplic and private IP addresses.

To test port connectivity:
	telnet www.google.com 80
	nmap -v www.google.com

Which ports are listening? And by which process? 
	netstat -ano
